## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties, flex and grid
- CSS media queries
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass (scss)
- Basic JavaScript

### What I learned

Before starting on this component I first learned the basics of Sass and the importance to define a file structure for the partials you'll be using. Then, when working on the component itself I researched on various methods to build the theme switcher and decided to go for the way in which CSS cutom properties and event listeners on JavaScript are used since I couldn't figure out a way to do it with just Sass variables and maps. I also learned how to target the local storage of the browser so that the theme chosen stays even after closing and reopening the website.

### Continued development

For continuing forward I will focus on improving the way I define CSS classes using BEM and study JavaScript event listeners to understand how an event is triggered and if one can determine the ocurrence of a user-triggered event versus a code-triggered event.
